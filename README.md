# NomadOne-ai

NomadOne is a locally deployed AI-powered chat bot designed for streamers. Unlike cloud-based bots, NomadOne operates directly on the user's computer, listens to voice commands in real time, and interacts with the Rumble API (or other streaming APIs) to post chat responses. It enhances stream engagement by allowing the streamer to speak naturally, while the bot interprets, processes, and responds in the chat.
